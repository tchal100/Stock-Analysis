All Stocks Analysis

	As a recent financial graduate Steve was excited to get his feet wet in the field of finance. 
  His parents who were extremely supportive, decided that this was the best opportunity to 
expand their portfolio. Steve’s parents have had a strong interest in the technology field and 
decided that they would seek to invest into DQ (DAQO), since the name brought back childhood 
memories. As a financial professional Steve knows that investments are not made on the whim. 
He has the best interest of his parents in mind and decided to have his team analyze data from 
DQ and other tech companies to reach a more informed decision.

Results of our Analysis

The first approach that was taken, was to analyze DQ (DAQO) from a profitability point of view.
 In order to do so, we ran the total daily volume of trades that DQ did for the year 2018. 
Our findings showed that although there was a significant number of trades, the information was not
an all-conclusive picture of DQ’s profitability. We took a step further 
and calculated the returns based on the number of daily trades and found that the returns were 
not favorable as can be seen in the table below.
 


Based on the outcomes, Steve wanted an analysis of all technology stock performance 
between 2017 and 2018. As a result, we were able to get a clear picture of which tech 
companies were the most profitable for each year. When we look at the Analysis, one can see 
that most of the companies had a profitable year, except for TERP which ended 2017 in the red 
with a -7.2%. DQ which was on our Initial spotlight, had a huge profitable performance with 
199.4% growth.

 

However, as we analyzed 2018 performance, we were surprised at the lack of sustainability 
between years. For example, all the performances dipped into the red except for ENPH and RUN 
which maintained their profitable performance. 

 

DQ which had the greatest performance in 2017 had a -62.6% return in 2018. By looking at a side
by side comparison, there are several conclusions that can be drawn from this analysis. 
 
First, although TERP were not in the green and had the worst year by far in 2017, they 
had a small growth of 2.2% in 2018, which made them the least versatile and long-term 
potential profitable option. Secondly, because of the significant changes we saw in 
performance we can assume that these companies are generally high-risk investments and thus 
an investor must be cautious. Steve was pleased with the results that we were able to reach and 
was also satisfied with the time saved in re-calculating the original script with the refactored calculations, as seen in the 2017 and 2018 charts above. 

Pros and Cons of Refactoring Summary 

Analysis on DQ company was completed by using specific codes to pull the necessary 
information needed to form a viable conclusion. While the calculation was a success, the need to 
be more efficient is always preferred when working with clients. Refactoring can be an 
advantage as it allows calculations to be completed in a shorter time. However, refactoring can 
be a lengthy process and, in many cases, create bugs. In reference to our “All Stock Analysis” on 
the tech companies, we often found errors throughout the process as we refactored the original 
VBA script. Many of the errors were because of incorrect wording used. However, refactoring 
does have its advantages and allows the restructuring of the code, making it more readable and 
maintainable while keeping its integrity.
